# Telecom Churn Prediction – Capstone Project

This capstone project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset to predict customer churn using machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Project Steps for setup
    1. Clone the Repository
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/telecom-churn-prediction.git
        cd telecom-churn-prediction
    2. Install Python 3
        Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system. You can verify using:
        "python --version" or "python3 --version"
        If not installed, download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    3. Download the Dataset
        Download the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle:
        Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
        After downloading, place the WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv file into the root directory of the project or a dedicated data/ folder.
    4. Create a Virtual Environment
        Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
        Windows - "python -m venv venv"
        macOS / Linux - "python3 -m venv venv"

## Workflow Overview
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding & Scaling
- Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
